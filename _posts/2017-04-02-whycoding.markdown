Wtf is coding you may ask. Don’t be alarmed I asked that too one day and now I’m studying it. To people with no coding knowledge like my (tech-challenged yet amazing) mother I simply say “well, you know how when you click on something on a web page and it takes you somewhere? It’s because of code” and they respond “ohhhhhhhh I get it”.

#### Ah, but if it was only that simple.

They also often associate people who code as nerdy guys who sit in front of their computers all day and have terrible social skills.

#### Well, I want to be one of those guys….but a girl….and with well developed social skills.

At the beginning of 2017 I decided to embark on a 6 month intense coding bootcamp which will hopefully turn me into a job ready web developer. The people that know me know I love a challenge and like to keep things new and interesting. Well this is by far the most challenging thing I have done and I love it so much. We have just come back from our first semester holidays which came well needed after the most hectic 5 weeks of my life. My brain, my poor poor brain. It didn’t know what had hit it after years of laying dormant from any challenging equations or constant problem solving, hey, it even forgot how to spell. It’s well exercised now and is staying fit by constantly think ALL THE TIME, especially just before bed (this was written at 12.30am), it’s great…

I couldn’t be happier with my decision to do the course even though it constantly makes me question my intelligence. I get to share this experience with 32 great students who make the very long hours we stay in the class enjoyable. There isn’t many things I would voluntarily do for 10+hours a day but coding has quickly become one of them. I’m studying at Coder Factory Academy which provides amazing teachers who have some of the best patience I have ever seen.

The time is flying and the course will be over before we know it but I’m definitely making the most of it and am super exciting to be developing my new career everyday!
